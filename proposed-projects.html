The well was first discovered in 1999 by Santos. The contingent resources are 355 bcf gas and 11 mmbbls of condensate.&nbsp;</h4><p>The Stanley Project development concept contemplates initial condensate production of 4,000 barrels per day utilising a two train refrigeration plant located in the field. The condensate will be transported via a 6 inch, 40 kilometre pipeline to a 6,000 barrel storage tank at Kiunga base then loaded onto a specially designed tanker with a 33,000 barrel capacity. The gas will be re-injected and sold later when the market becomes available.</p><p>The APDL and APL were lodged with the Department on 28 August 2012. DPE did all the necessary reviews, and after the Gas Agreement was signed, the Department including relevant State proceeded and conducted the development forum in Kiunga.</p><p>The forum concluded on 30thMay 2014 with the signing of the Development Agreement and the Petroleum Minister Hon. Nixon Duban ,issued the PDL and PL to the project proponents on the same day. &nbsp;Construction and development of the project has not started yet due to the issue of operatorship between Horizon and Talisman. The matter was resolve in 26th January 2015, when Talisman was formally recognized as the operator of the project.&nbsp;</p><p>It is now agreed that the project development would be differed for at least a year as Talisman will have to undertake a review of the development due to the fall in oil prices. Some urgent tasks on the project are yet to be resolved to allow the project to commence operations without hindrance. The Department is continuously working with other State agencies to resolve them.</p><p><a class="hover-effect" style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1;" href="#"><img alt="" width="847" height="392" src="/uploads/versions/kumul terminal 2---x0-293-3072-1422-847-392x---.jpg" />&nbsp;</a></p></div></section><section class="services-checmicals"><div class="chemicals"><div class="spacer-50">&nbsp;</div><h2 class="chemicals-title color-title">KETU/ELEVALA GAS CONDENSATE PROJECT</h2><h4 class="chemicals-subtitle subtitle">The Ketu and Elevala fields consist of over 1 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of gas and approximately 55 million barrels (mmbbls) of condensate.&nbsp;</h4><p>The Project Development Concept contemplates a gas condensate development focused on near term condensate recovery with gas sales to follow. The condensate will be processed in the fields and transported by pipeline to Kiunga for export. The gas will be re-injected and sold later as LNG.</p><p>The Department received the application for a petroleum development license (APDL) from Horizon Oil on 17th March 2014. However because of indifference's between JV partners in the lodgement of the APDL, DPE advised Horizon to meet with all its JV partners to reach a consensus before DPE can proceed with the review of the application.</p><p>A project Team was formed in August 2014 to review the APDL and APL applications. The review plus all other associated work leading up to grant of the PDL and commencement of the project have also not started due to no funding support from the Government. The Department has phased the work program due to this situation but even the reduced work program has not been funded.</p><p>Social mapping and landowner identification studies was conducted by the Licensees under section 47 Oil &amp; Gas Act 1998. Landowner beneficiary identification is currently in progress. The Technical review (sub-surface and facilities) has been completed by NCPC . The APDL review lacks progress in other key project activities such as legal, economics and environmental reviews.

There are condensates but not as abundant as the natural gas (Dry gas).</h4><p>The field is located about 40 KM from Kiunga and 20 KMfrom Tabubil, Western Province. Current Joint Venture Partners of PRL include Esso Highlands Pty Ltd (21.01 %), Ampolex (PNG) Pty Ltd (27.9798 %), Oil Search PNG (32.50 %), Merlin Petroleum Company (12.5 %), and Oil Search PNG (6.0102 %)</p><p>The Project partners plan to connect the P&rsquo;nyang gas field with existing gas facilities of the PNG LNG in Kutubu.

However, accelerated gas, which is a concept of expediting supply of domestic gas from the foundation project (PNG LNG) will commence in 2016. P&rsquo;nyang production will come online at the time production from the foundation project decline. ExxonMobil has completed the full scale Social Mapping in PRL3 blocks along the proposed pipeline corridors. Names of main clans, sub-clans and individuals have been established.</p><p>An MOU was signed on 16th January 2015 between State and the developer, ExxonMobil to enable supply of domestic gas from foundation Project by July 2015. The MOU requires the award of APDL by 31st March 2015 and reserves the rights of the developer to include P&rsquo;nyang gas field as expansion project of the PNG LNG Gas project area. The Department received an APDL and two APLs from ExxonMobil on 6th February 2015 to develop P&rsquo;nyang gas field and registered them as APDL 13, APL 12, and APL 13 respectively.&nbsp;</p><p>In preparation for the development of the project, the Department on July 11th 2014 established the P&rsquo;nyang project review team to liaise and coordinate with project partners on all process leading up to the lodgement of APDL and the Development forum. Landowner clan vetting was successfully carried out by the DPE term from 6th October to 5th November 2015 with the Ministerial Determination done and submitted to the Minister.</p><p>DPE is now working on the planning process for the Development Forum which is likely to be held on the first week of December 2015 where the Petroleum Development License will be issued to Exxon Mobile to develop the Project.<br />&nbsp;</p></div></section><section class="services-checmicals"><div class="chemicals"><a class="hover-effect" href="#"><img alt="" width="847" height="392" src="/uploads/versions/osl rig 104 moran well site---x0-1195-1712-792-847-392x---.jpg" /> </a><div class="spacer-50">&nbsp;</div><h2 class="chemicals-title color-title">MANANDA ARTIC OIL PROJECT&nbsp;</h2><h4 class="chemicals-subtitle subtitle">Oil was recently discovered in Mananda 5 &amp; 6 wells within the vicinity of the Kutubu oil fields.</h4><p>There is an estimate of 100 MMbls of oil in place though about 20 million barrels is recoverable.

InterOil Limited is now working closely with Total SA to jointly develop the Elk/Antelope LNG Project. However, all technical work is only been done in the background pending conclusion of the Arbitration on ownership of license by InterOil. DPE recently summoned InterOil to provide an indication on when the fields should be developed and they have indicated that this would most likely be in 2016 &ndash; 2017.</p><p>The DPE and the State negotiation team have since finalized a work program to discuss with the project proponents on how to develop the fields though this will also depend on funding support. Nonetheless, the Project concept will be reviewed by the Department so that we can take a proactive and holistic approach to the Development of the concept and minimize the repeat of the problems now encountered with the PNG LNG Project.</p><p>Total SA have identify certain location for the Plant site and the Pipeline route but have not yet decided on the location. InterOil has done full scale SMLIS for the PDL, Pipeline and the Plant site and have submitted to the DPE.
